This document outlines potential future architectural evolutions for Archiverse Theia.

## Mixed Architecture: Web Worker for Viewpoints / Full Host for Architects

While the primary architecture involves a separate `Archiverse ontology host` process for scalability and resource isolation (ideal for complex modeling tasks and power users), a potential future enhancement could introduce a lighter-weight mode leveraging browser Web Workers.

**Concept:**

*   **Full Experience (Current Architecture):** Architects using the full Theia Application (Electron or Browser) would connect to the dedicated `Archiverse ontology host` process as currently documented. This provides the full range of language services, persistence integration, and potentially complex GLSP interactions handled server-side.
*   **Lightweight Viewpoint Experience (Future):** For users primarily focused on viewing or performing limited edits on specific ArchiMate viewpoints, a different mode could be offered, potentially via a simpler web interface or a restricted Theia profile.
    *   In this mode, the core `Archiverse ontology` logic (parsing, validation for the specific viewpoint's scope) could run within a **Web Worker** in the user's browser.
    *   The frontend application would launch and manage this worker.
    *   Data for the specific viewpoint would be fetched via RPC calls to **Theia Backend Contributions**. These contributions would interact directly with the **Persistence Layer**.
    *   This eliminates the need for the user's session to connect to or rely on the separate `Archiverse ontology host` process for basic viewpoint rendering and validation.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Infrastructure Load:** Less reliance on the central `Archiverse ontology host` for simple viewing tasks.
*   **Simplified Access:** Potentially allows embedding viewpoints in other web applications more easily.
*   **Lower Barrier to Entry:** Offers a quicker-loading, less resource-intensive option for casual users or reviewers.

**Challenges:**

*   **Feature Subset:** Defining the appropriate subset of features available in the lightweight mode.
*   **Data Synchronization:** Managing data consistency between the worker's view and the backend persistence layer.
*   **Implementation Complexity:** Maintaining two distinct modes of operation for language services (host-based vs. worker-based).

**Conclusion:**

This mixed approach could offer flexibility, catering to different user needs and deployment scenarios. The current architecture based on the separate `Archiverse ontology host` remains the foundation for the full architect experience, while the web worker approach presents a potential future optimization for specific use cases.
